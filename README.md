### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eena, a full-stack developer with a startup experince.

Iâ€™m a problem solver with a creative mindset, and as a visually oriented person, Iâ€™m particularly interested in front-end development. However, I find that full-stack development, with a good balance of both frontend and backend, suits me well.

ðŸŒ± My ongoing projects: Building a Tinder clone using Nextjs,  MongoDB certificate course.
